Foursquare: Dataset from the Foursquare social media with
multiple aspect trajectories from users in New York, USA
[27]. Trajectories are split in weeks and we select 193 users
with at least 10 check-ins in each trajectory, totalling 3, 079
trajectories. The points are enriched with semantic information
of weekday, POI category, weather condition, and with the
numerical information of the price and rating of the POIs.
