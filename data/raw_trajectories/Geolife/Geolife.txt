GeoLife: Dataset from the GeoLife project [7] with
daily trajectories of 182 users. The classes in this dataset are
transportation mode (bike, bus, car, subway, train, taxi, walk).
As the dataset is dense, after removing duplicated records we
split trajectories with time gaps, we selected the transportation
mode trajectories with more than 100 points and we selected
20% of the total trajectories from each transportation mode,
resulting in a dataset with 1, 763 trajectories.
