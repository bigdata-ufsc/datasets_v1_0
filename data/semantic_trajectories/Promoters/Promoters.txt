Data Set Information:

This dataset has been developed to help evaluate a "hybrid" learning algorithm ("KBANN") that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting knowledge. Using a "leave-one-out" methodology, the following errors were produced by various ML algorithms. (See Towell, Shavlik, & Noordewier, 1990, for details.)

System -- Errors -- Comments
----------------------------------------------------------------
KBANN -- 4/106 -- a hybrid ML system
BP -- 8/106 -- std backprop with one hidden layer
O'Neill -- 12/106 -- ad hoc technique from the bio. lit.
Near-Neigh -- 13/106 -- a nearest-neighbor algo (k=3)
ID3 -- 19/106 -- Quinlan's decision-tree builder

Type of domain: non-numeric, nominal (one of A, G, T, C)


Note: DNA nucleotides can be grouped into a hierarchy, as shown below:

X (any)
/ \
(purine) R Y (pyrimidine)
/ \ / \
A G T C


Here is that hierachy in a text-friendly format:

X (any)
. R (purine)
. . A
. . G
. Y (pyrimidine)
. . T
. . C


Attribute Information:

1. One of {+/-}, indicating the class ("+" = promoter).
2. The instance name (non-promoters named by position in the 1500-long nucleotide sequence provided by T. Record).
3-59. The remaining 57 fields are the sequence, starting at position -50 (p-50) and ending at position +7 (p7). Each of these fields is filled by one of {a, g, t, c}.
