Brightkite : Multiple aspect trajectories from users of the
Brightkite social media [26], with the semantic and the spatiotemporal reference of the check-in place. Trajectories are split
in weeks, and we used a total of 300 random users for analysis,
with a filter of a minimum of 10 points per trajectory. The
check-in points were enriched with the semantic information of the weekday and the resultant dataset has a total of 7, 911
trajectories and 130, 494 trajectory points.
